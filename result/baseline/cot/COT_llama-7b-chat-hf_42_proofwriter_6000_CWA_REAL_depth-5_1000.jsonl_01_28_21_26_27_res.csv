Please answer the following questions:

1. Can the query ""Bob is rough"" be inferred from the given context?
2. If yes, how?
3. Can the query ""Anne is green"" be inferred from the given context?
4. If yes, how?

Answer:

1. Yes, the query ""Bob is rough"" can be inferred from the given context.

The context describes Anne's properties (big, kind, rough), and then mentions Bob's property (white). Since Anne is not white, Bob must be rough. Therefore, the query ""Bob is rough"" can be inferred from the context.
